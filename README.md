# NaturalDisaster

# Idea for codefundoo++
The basic challenge is to find better ways to save lives and prevent economic losses from natural disasters.

We can monitor the basic atmospheric properties like wind speed, temperature, humidity and air pressure using devices and analyse them according to our needs, compare with previous data to predict whether a natural disaster can occur or not.

## Predicting Natural Disaster(Earthquake or tsunami) 
The idea is to predict earthquakes or tsunami , so that preventive measures can be taken and  we can monitor the movement of the people(to direct them to safe places) . We can deploy some devices in some different parts of the cities that will record the above mentioned movement of people and the data collected to a central system that would record these quantities.
Further we can compare the data collected to our previous dataset containing the similar elements and find a similar data corresponding to our present system.
earthquakes are generally the result of propagating seismic waves underneath the surface  of the earth.  The  vertical  motion  of  the  surface  waves  can be  recorded  by  the  devices installed  in  different geographical  positions to  measure the  earthquake across the globe.we can collect all the above mentioned data and use our device to predict earthquake
We can also monitor ocean waves and other things to predict tsunami.
We will store the previous dataset in terms of the properties and what level of disaster happened in those circumstances.For eg:- we can have a data in which we predict the areas which are more prone to earthquakes and then we will monitor the movement of people, suppose people are moving towards wrong direction where there is more probablility of earthquake or tsunami,then we can stop them from going there and recommend a better safe place.

### Impact to the people
We would be sending the details to server every few minutes, and they would be synchronised in a way such that there is not much load on the server. When a situation of earthquake or tsunami  occurs, the message would be sent to the concerned authorities so that they can issue an alert in the region, also we can install alarms in the devices itself that would ring in case of warnings and stop the movement of people from going in wrong direction.
This can save many lives as people can be sent to safe places if the storm is about to come.Since we will also be informing the Authorities ,they can make proper arrangements for the people and people with temporary houses can also take some prevention so that there houses do not get destroyed.
This would save many lives and property.

### Feasability
There would only be the installation costs of the devices in cities in few kms stretch. The cost of developing and maintaining the software won't be much as compared to installation.The data could be sent and received using satellite transmission, in this way areas with no or limited internet connection would also be able to use these devices and softwares. We would need a server to store the past data of the happenings and all the parameters that we have included in our design.This would take up some investment but that is only one time.
So, the maintainabilty cost would be only of the devices and that too minimal.
